# Text-Sort
This program will list all the words (alphabetical characters only) in a text file and the number of times it appears.
The program IS case sensitive. If multiple files are in the input, it will count for all files, not each one individually.
There are three ways to input files: one is so set the WORD_FREAK variable to the name of a text file.
This will only input one file. 
Another way to input files is so simply list them in the command line following the program name.
The name of the compiled program is wordFreak.
Files can also be accepted from standard input through piping.
The program uses a linked list orientation, so extremely large files may take some time to load.
